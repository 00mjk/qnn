# qnn
An implementation of a quantum neural network built using pyquil.

Black-box framework for training quantum neural networks with classical input and output using Rigetti's pyQuil quantum programming library. Quantum neuron implementation based on Cao, Guerreschi, and Aspuru-Guzik's proposal: https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.11240. Work in progress.
